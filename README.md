# email-validation-software
Check single/list of email addresses for validity.

This software uses a regex expression to check the email address either entered in the text field or from the list imported in the software. It will produce two text files, one containing the email addresses that are valid and the other containing invalid email addresses.

> The solution provided won't check if the email exists or not, it will only check for the validity of the email address.

> The only correct solution seems to be the one where you actually send an email and see the response.
